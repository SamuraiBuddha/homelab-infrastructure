# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### Contact Information
- **Primary Contact:** Jordan Ehrig - jordan@ehrig.dev
- **Response Time:** Within 24 hours for critical issues
- **Secure Communication:** Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting

## Vulnerability Handling

### Severity Levels
- **Critical:** Remote code execution, infrastructure compromise, credential exposure
- **High:** Privilege escalation, authentication bypass, system access breach
- **Medium:** Information disclosure, service disruption, configuration exposure
- **Low:** Minor issues with limited impact

### Response Timeline
- **Critical:** 24 hours
- **High:** 72 hours  
- **Medium:** 1 week
- **Low:** 2 weeks

## Security Measures

### PowerShell Security
- Execution policy enforcement and script signing
- Secure credential management with PowerShell SecureString
- Input validation and parameter binding
- Error handling to prevent information disclosure
- PowerShell Constrained Language Mode where appropriate
- Script integrity verification

### Infrastructure Security
- Secure remote management protocols (WinRM/PSRemoting over HTTPS)
- Network segmentation and firewall controls
- Privileged access management (PAM)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security scanning
- Configuration drift detection and remediation
- Automated security compliance monitoring

### Homelab Security
- Network isolation and VLAN segmentation
- Secure authentication mechanisms
- Regular security patching and updates
- Backup encryption and secure storage
- Monitoring and alerting systems
- Access logging and audit trails

## Incident Response Plan

### Detection
1. **Automated:** Security monitoring alerts, system anomalies
2. **Manual:** Administrator reports, audit findings
3. **Monitoring:** Unusual network traffic or system behavior

### Response
1. **Assess:** Determine severity and infrastructure impact
2. **Contain:** Isolate affected systems and networks
3. **Investigate:** Forensic analysis and root cause investigation
4. **Remediate:** Apply patches and configuration fixes
5. **Recover:** Restore normal infrastructure operations
6. **Learn:** Post-incident review and improvements

## Security Audits

### Regular Security Reviews
- **Script Review:** Every PowerShell script update
- **Infrastructure Scan:** Weekly vulnerability assessments
- **Configuration Audit:** Monthly compliance checks
- **Penetration Test:** Quarterly infrastructure testing

### Last Security Audit
- **Date:** 2025-07-03 (Initial setup)
- **Scope:** Architecture review and security template deployment
